The Find My add-on delivers reference software and libraries for developing Find My accessories in the nRF Connect SDK.

Highlights
**********

This release covers the following features:

* Support for *pair before use* accessories, also called coexistence feature.
* NFC support using the NFC-A Type 2 Tag library.
* A new sample for the SuperBinary tool that can create a SuperBinary file
  remotely using GitHub Actions.

Release tag
***********

The release tag for the Find My add-on for nRF Connect SDK repository is **v1.7.0**.
This release is compatible with nRF Connect SDK **v1.7.0** tag.

Installing
**********

Follow the instructions in the :ref:`ncs_install` document.
Run the following command to install this specific release version:

.. code-block:: console

    west init -m https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf --mr v1.7.0

Supported development kits
**************************

* PCA10040 (nRF52832 Development Kit)
* PCA10056 (nRF52840 Development Kit)
* PCA10100 (nRF52833 Development Kit)

Changelog
*********

* Added the Coexistence sample that demonstrates how to create firmware for *pair before use* accessories.
* Added support for *pair before use* accessories in the Find My stack.
* Added new API in the Find My header file for *pair before use* accessories.
* Added conceptual docs for *pair before use* accessories.
* Added conceptual docs for firmware update with UARP.
* Added NFC support to the Find My stack using the NFC-A Type 2 Tag library.
* Enabled NFC support in the Find My Simple and Qualification samples.
* Added logic for removing Bluetooth LE bond information of a peer that does not finish the Find My pairing procedure.
* Added queue mechanism to the Find My Network service to handle simultaneous requests for sending indications.
* Added support for custom serial numbers from provisioned data.
* Added option to configure transmit power used in Find My advertising and connections.
* Fixed the advertising timeout after disconnect in the persistent connection mode.
* Increased the MCUboot partition size for the ``Release`` variant in affected samples to support nRF52840 target.
* Providing version information is optional for a SuperBinary tool,
  because it can read the version from the source MCUBoot image.

Known issues and limitations
****************************

* nRF52832 and nRF52833 SoCs are only supported in the ``Release`` configuration due to memory limitations.
* Find My characteristics are always available regardless of the accessory state.
  This limitation will require a waiver for Find My qualification.
* Find My pairing may sometimes fail due to the connection timeout (especially in the Find My Coexistence sample).
  The root cause of this behaviour is a low value of the link supervision timeout parameter.
* In certain corner cases, the settings storage gets permanently polluted with invalid GATT data that are associated with Find My connections.
  The pollution may be caused by the following settings items handled by the GATT layer:

    * Client Characteristic Configuration (CCC) descriptor: regardless of application configuration options.
    * Client Features (CF) status: if you enabled the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_GATT_CACHING` configuration option.
    * Service Changed (SC) status: if you enabled the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_GATT_SERVICE_CHANGED` configuration option.
  The issue is fixed on the nRF Connect SDK **main** branch and in all releases beginning from the **v2.4.0** tag.

  **Workaround** (for in-field products affected by this issue):

  Migrate your firmware to the **v2.4.0** nRF Connect SDK release or newer and enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_BT_BOND_CLEAR` Kconfig option to automatically clear the settings storage pollution during the :c:func:`fmna_enable` function.
  Depending on your DFU capabilities and preference, you can choose one of the following approaches of delivering the fix to your customers:
    * If your DFU method supports the incremental updates feature, you can specify a requirement that an accessory must be running a specific firmware version to update to the newer version.
      In this case, you can prepare two DFU packages with the following properties:

        1. The older version with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_BT_BOND_CLEAR` option enabled.
        #. The newer one with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_BT_BOND_CLEAR` option disabled and a requirement to trigger an update only for the firmware version from the first package.
    * If your DFU method does not support incremental updates, prepare one DFU package with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_BT_BOND_CLEAR` option enabled.
      You can disable this option in one of the future updates (for example, within a year) once you are confident that your users have their settings storage cleared with the initial update.

* Unpairing from the device in the :c:member:`bt_conn_cb.security_changed` callback using :c:func:`bt_unpair` function results in a NULL pointer dereference in the Bluetooth Host keys module.
  This function call is used for rejecting a simultaneous pairing attempt.
  The issue is fixed on the nRF Connect SDK **main** branch and in all releases beginning from the **v2.4.1** tag.

  **Workaround:** Manually port changes with fix to ``sdk-zephyr`` (commit hash ``cd264b21e4a90ed85a63116bd148b890ab347db8`` from the upstream ``zephyr`` repository).
