Changelog
*********

* Changed error handling behavior in both application and MCUboot bootloader configurations, for all Find My samples as follows:

  * Enabled the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_RESET_ON_FATAL_ERROR` Kconfig option by default in the ``Release`` variant.
  * Disabled the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_RESET_ON_FATAL_ERROR` Kconfig option by default in the ``Debug`` variant.

* Improved the mechanism of injecting the Find My Long Term Key (LTK) into the Bluetooth stack.
  The Bluetooth LE stack no longer associates the Find My connection with any Bluetooth LE bond.
* Added a clearing operation for bond data of the Find My peers during the :c:func:`fmna_enable` API call to avoid pollution of the settings area with unused data.
  You can use the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_BT_BOND_CLEAR` Kconfig option to enable the clearing operation.
  The configuration is disabled by default.
* Added the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_LOG_MFI_AUTH_TOKEN_FORMAT` Kconfig option to enable printing the MFi Authentication Token in either HEX or Base64 format:

  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_LOG_MFI_AUTH_TOKEN_HEX_SHORT` Kconfig option logs only the first 16 bytes of the token in the HEX format.
  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_LOG_MFI_AUTH_TOKEN_HEX_FULL` Kconfig option logs the full token with trimmed trailing zeros in the HEX format.
  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_LOG_MFI_AUTH_TOKEN_BASE64_SHORT` Kconfig option logs both first and last 16 characters of the Base64 encoded token.
  * The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_LOG_MFI_AUTH_TOKEN_BASE64_FULL` Kconfig option logs the full Base64 encoded token.
  * The MFi Authentication Token is now printed in the Base64 format (:kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_LOG_MFI_AUTH_TOKEN_BASE64_SHORT`) during the Find My initialization.

* Limited log severity to avoid flooding logs while performing UARP transfer.
* Added the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_UARP_LOG_TRANSFER_THROUGHPUT` Kconfig option to enable logging UARP transfer throughput.
* Fixed an issue with applying the application-specific board configuration overlays in the Find My Thingy application.
  The board configuration files were not applied when the application was built from a directory other than the Find My Thingy application directory.
* Fixed an issue in the Softdevice Controller library that used 0 dBm for Find My connection TX power regardless of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_TX_POWER` Kconfig option value.
  The Find My connection TX power is now correctly inherited from the Find My advertising set as configured by the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_TX_POWER` Kconfig option.
* Fixed an issue with overlaying authentication callbacks using the :c:func:`bt_conn_auth_cb_overlay` function in the :file:`fmna_conn.c` file during the Find My connection establishment.
  This API function is used to enforce the Just Works pairing method and resulted in a NULL pointer dereference, which led to undefined behavior.
  For non-secure targets (nRF5340 DK and Thingy:53), it resulted in a SecureFault exception and a crash.

CLI Tools
=========

* Added the ``-i/--input-file`` option to the ``extract`` command in the Find My CLI tools package, which allows to provide file with settings partition memory dump instead of reading memory directly from the device.
* Reimplemented the algorithm for ``extract`` command in the Find My CLI tools package to closer follow the entry identification logic of the Settings and NVS firmware modules from Zephyr.
* Fixed an issue in the ``extract`` command of the Find My CLI tools package, which caused the older token to be read instead of the latest one.

Known issues and limitations
****************************

* nRF52832 and nRF52833 SoCs are only supported in the ``Release`` configuration due to memory limitations.
* nRF5340 SoC supports a maximum transmit power of 3 dBm, violating the Find My specification requirement for 4 dBm.
* Find My characteristics are always available regardless of the accessory state.
  This limitation will require a waiver for Find My qualification.
* Firmware updates of the nRF5340 network core are not supported with the UARP protocol.
* Invalid timer period comparison in the Motion Detection module causes Unwanted Tracking Detection to work incorrectly and crash the application due to the unsatisfied assert statement.
  A fix introduced in the Zephyr kernel changed the way the timer period is set and it is necessary to align the Motion Detection module with this change.
  The issue is fixed on the nRF Connect SDK **main** branch and in all releases beginning from the **v2.4.1** tag.
  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply commit with fix to ``sdk-find-my`` (commit hash: ``68e82297568d9c8e1d244e87858b4bd332643605``).
* Unpairing from the device in the :c:member:`bt_conn_cb.security_changed` callback using :c:func:`bt_unpair` function results in an assertion in the ``Debug`` configuration or NULL pointer dereference in the ``Release`` configuration in the Bluetooth Host keys module.
  This function call is used for rejecting a simultaneous pairing attempt.
  The issue is fixed on the nRF Connect SDK **main** branch and in all releases beginning from the **v2.4.1** tag.

  **Workaround:** Manually port changes with fix to ``sdk-zephyr`` (commit hash ``cd264b21e4a90ed85a63116bd148b890ab347db8`` from the upstream ``zephyr`` repository).
* Find My pairing is rejected during the Just Works Bluetooth LE pairing phase if the device is already bonded with the same peer on any Bluetooth identity.
  The issue can be reproduced in the case of the pair before use accessories.
  These types of accessories usually bond using their main Bluetooth application identity and prevent the Find My pairing flow in the "Bonding" mode from succeeding.
  In this case, the Find My pairing fails as the Zephyr Bluetooth Host cannot store more than one bond for the same peer (identified by the Identity Address).
  The issue is fixed on the nRF Connect SDK **main** branch and in all releases beginning from the **v2.5.0** tag.

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply commits with fixes to:

  * ``sdk-zephyr`` (commit hash ``9a0b8a317a91089f048c38233635240f21ab298d``)
  * ``sdk-find-my`` (commit hash ``36e75564d83b2d2068e08d9d9df7cbfedd668cb6``)
