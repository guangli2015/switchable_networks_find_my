Limitations
***********

* Documentation might be incomplete.
* NFC is not supported.
* nRF52832 and nRF52833 SoCs are only supported in the ``Release`` configuration due to memory limitations.
* Find My characteristics are always available regardless of the accessory state.
  This limitation will require waiver for Find My qualification.

Known issues
************

* Find My pairing may sometimes fail due to the connection timeout (especially in the Find My Coexistence sample).
  The root cause of this behaviour is a low value of the link supervision timeout parameter.
* In certain corner cases, the settings storage gets permanently polluted with invalid GATT data that are associated with Find My connections.
  The pollution may be caused by the following settings items handled by the GATT layer:

    * Client Characteristic Configuration (CCC) descriptor: regardless of application configuration options.
    * Client Features (CF) status: if you enabled the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_GATT_CACHING` configuration option.
    * Service Changed (SC) status: if you enabled the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_GATT_SERVICE_CHANGED` configuration option.
  The issue is fixed on the nRF Connect SDK **main** branch and in all releases beginning from the **v2.4.0** tag.

  **Workaround** (for in-field products affected by this issue):

  Migrate your firmware to the **v2.4.0** nRF Connect SDK release or newer and enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_BT_BOND_CLEAR` Kconfig option to automatically clear the settings storage pollution during the :c:func:`fmna_enable` function.
  Depending on your DFU capabilities and preference, you can choose one of the following approaches of delivering the fix to your customers:
    * If your DFU method supports the incremental updates feature, you can specify a requirement that an accessory must be running a specific firmware version to update to the newer version.
      In this case, you can prepare two DFU packages with the following properties:

        1. The older version with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_BT_BOND_CLEAR` option enabled.
        #. The newer one with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_BT_BOND_CLEAR` option disabled and a requirement to trigger an update only for the firmware version from the first package.
    * If your DFU method does not support incremental updates, prepare one DFU package with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_BT_BOND_CLEAR` option enabled.
      You can disable this option in one of the future updates (for example, within a year) once you are confident that your users have their settings storage cleared with the initial update.
