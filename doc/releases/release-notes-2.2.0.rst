Changelog
*********

* The Find My library uses the pure Oberon library for Find My cryptographic operations
  when the nrfxlib Security module is not enabled and the RNG peripheral is available in the CPU image.
  This new default configuration frees around 4 kB of flash memory.
* By default, the Find My accessory requests longer supervision timeout in the Connection Parameter Update procedure.
  The new timeout value reduces disconnection probability due to the connection timeout.
* Aligned references to all public Zephyr headers that have been moved to the :file:`include/zephyr` folder.
* Fixed the return value check of Bluetooth identity creation in the Find My Thingy application.
* Improved RTT logging (bigger RTT buffer) of the ``Debug`` configuration in Find My projects.
* Added motion and speaker platform abstraction in the Find My application.
  Platform implementations now support both Thingy:53 and Thingy:52.
* In the Find My Coexistence sample, added a mechanism for activating and deactivating Find My on a long **Button 1** press with the status indication displayed on the **LED 4**.
* In the Find My Connection module, fixed the :c:func:`bt_conn_foreach` API calls that are used to iterate over connected peers.
* Added a new :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_SERVICE_HIDDEN_MODE` configuration option for hiding Find My services in the disabled state of the FMN stack.
* Enabled the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_SERVICE_HIDDEN_MODE` configuration option in the Find My Coexistence sample.
* Added a new callback to the Find My API. It notifies the user about the Find My pairing failure.
* Added a log indication of the Find My pairing failure to the Find My Simple and Qualification samples.
* The FMN stack advertises with a new Bluetooth address in case of a Find My pairing failure to work around the iOS issue with the cached bond information.
* Fixed an issue with the Unpair command rejection when the command was used in the same connection session as the Find My pairing.
  The issue caused the FMN stack to persist in the paired state when the Find My app user cancelled the pairing flow after a successful pairing packet exchange.
* All accessory parameters that are configurable by iOS are set to their default values after the Unpair procedure.

CLI Tools
=========

* Fixed the :ref:`super_on_github` sample on Windows platform.

Known issues and limitations
****************************

* nRF52832 and nRF52833 SoCs are only supported in the ``Release`` configuration due to memory limitations.
* nRF5340 SoC supports a maximum transmit power of 3dBm, violating the Find My specification requirement for 4dBm.
* Find My characteristics are always available regardless of the accessory state.
  This limitation will require a waiver for Find My qualification.
* Firmware updates of the nRF5340 network core are not supported with the UARP protocol.
* In certain corner cases, the settings storage gets permanently polluted with invalid GATT data that are associated with Find My connections.
  The pollution may be caused by the following settings items handled by the GATT layer:

    * Client Characteristic Configuration (CCC) descriptor: regardless of application configuration options.
    * Client Features (CF) status: if you enabled the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_GATT_CACHING` configuration option.
    * Service Changed (SC) status: if you enabled the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_GATT_SERVICE_CHANGED` configuration option.
  The issue is fixed on the nRF Connect SDK **main** branch and in all releases beginning from the **v2.4.0** tag.

  **Workaround** (for in-field products affected by this issue):

  Migrate your firmware to the **v2.4.0** nRF Connect SDK release or newer and enable the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_BT_BOND_CLEAR` Kconfig option to automatically clear the settings storage pollution during the :c:func:`fmna_enable` function.
  Depending on your DFU capabilities and preference, you can choose one of the following approaches of delivering the fix to your customers:
    * If your DFU method supports the incremental updates feature, you can specify a requirement that an accessory must be running a specific firmware version to update to the newer version.
      In this case, you can prepare two DFU packages with the following properties:

        1. The older version with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_BT_BOND_CLEAR` option enabled.
        #. The newer one with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_BT_BOND_CLEAR` option disabled and a requirement to trigger an update only for the firmware version from the first package.
    * If your DFU method does not support incremental updates, prepare one DFU package with the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_BT_BOND_CLEAR` option enabled.
      You can disable this option in one of the future updates (for example, within a year) once you are confident that your users have their settings storage cleared with the initial update.
* The Softdevice Controller library incorrectly uses 0 dBm for Find My connection TX power regardless of the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_FMNA_TX_POWER` Kconfig option value.
  The issue is fixed on the nRF Connect SDK **main** branch and in all releases beginning from the **v2.4.0** tag.
* Overlaying authentication callbacks using the :c:func:`bt_conn_auth_cb_overlay` function in the :file:`fmna_conn.c` file during the Find My connection establishment results in a NULL pointer dereference, which leads to undefined behavior.
  This API function is used to enforce the Just Works pairing method.
  For non-secure targets (nRF5340 DK and Thingy:53), it results in a SecureFault exception and a crash.
  The issue is fixed on the nRF Connect SDK **main** branch and in all releases beginning from the **v2.4.0** tag.
  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply commit with fix to ``sdk-zephyr`` (commit hash: ``10d1197916f81fd8017c2962a88476aba671c773``).
* Unpairing from the device in the :c:member:`bt_conn_cb.security_changed` callback using :c:func:`bt_unpair` function results in an assertion in the ``Debug`` configuration or NULL pointer dereference in the ``Release`` configuration in the Bluetooth Host keys module.
  This function call is used for rejecting a simultaneous pairing attempt.
  The issue is fixed on the nRF Connect SDK **main** branch and in all releases beginning from the **v2.4.1** tag.

  **Workaround:** Manually port changes with fix to ``sdk-zephyr`` (commit hash ``cd264b21e4a90ed85a63116bd148b890ab347db8`` from the upstream ``zephyr`` repository).
* Find My pairing is rejected during the Just Works Bluetooth LE pairing phase if the device is already bonded with the same peer on any Bluetooth identity.
  The issue can be reproduced in the case of the pair before use accessories.
  These types of accessories usually bond using their main Bluetooth application identity and prevent the Find My pairing flow in the "Bonding" mode from succeeding.
  In this case, the Find My pairing fails as the Zephyr Bluetooth Host cannot store more than one bond for the same peer (identified by the Identity Address).
  The issue is fixed on the nRF Connect SDK **main** branch and in all releases beginning from the **v2.5.0** tag.

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply commits with fixes to:

  * ``sdk-zephyr`` (commit hash ``9a0b8a317a91089f048c38233635240f21ab298d``)
  * ``sdk-find-my`` (commit hash ``36e75564d83b2d2068e08d9d9df7cbfedd668cb6``)
