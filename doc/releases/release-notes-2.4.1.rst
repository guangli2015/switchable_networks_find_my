Changelog
*********

* Fixed an invalid timer period comparison in the Motion Detection module, which caused Unwanted Tracking Detection to work incorrectly and crash the application due to the unsatisfied assert statement.
  A fix introduced in the Zephyr kernel changed the way the timer period is set and it was necessary to align the Motion Detection module with this change.
* Fixed an issue with the :c:func:`bt_unpair` function call in the :c:member:`bt_conn_cb.security_changed` callback of the Find My Pairing module.
  This operation resulted in an assertion in the ``Debug`` configuration or NULL pointer dereference in the ``Release`` configuration in the Bluetooth Host keys module.
  This function call is used for rejecting a simultaneous pairing attempt.

Known issues and limitations
****************************

* nRF52832 and nRF52833 SoCs are only supported in the ``Release`` configuration due to memory limitations.
* nRF5340 SoC supports a maximum transmit power of 3 dBm, violating the Find My specification requirement for 4 dBm.
* Find My characteristics are always available regardless of the accessory state.
  This limitation will require a waiver for Find My qualification.
* Firmware updates of the nRF5340 network core are not supported with the UARP protocol.
* Find My pairing is rejected during the Just Works Bluetooth LE pairing phase if the device is already bonded with the same peer on any Bluetooth identity.
  The issue can be reproduced in the case of the pair before use accessories.
  These types of accessories usually bond using their main Bluetooth application identity and prevent the Find My pairing flow in the "Bonding" mode from succeeding.
  In this case, the Find My pairing fails as the Zephyr Bluetooth Host cannot store more than one bond for the same peer (identified by the Identity Address).
  The issue is fixed on the nRF Connect SDK **main** branch and in all releases beginning from the **v2.5.0** tag.

  **Workaround:** Manually cherry-pick and apply commits with fixes to:

  * ``sdk-zephyr`` (commit hash ``9a0b8a317a91089f048c38233635240f21ab298d``)
  * ``sdk-find-my`` (commit hash ``36e75564d83b2d2068e08d9d9df7cbfedd668cb6``)
